You can also create a json document by supplying a Map to Rest Assured.
HashMap store items in "key/value" pairs. One object is used as a key (index) to another object (value).

Create a HashMap object called capitalCities that will store String keys and String values:

import java.util.HashMap; // import the HashMap class
HashMap<String, String> capitalCities = new HashMap<String, String>();

// Add keys and values (Country, City)
    capitalCities.put("England", "London");
    capitalCities.put("Germany", "Berlin");
    capitalCities.put("Norway", "Oslo");
    capitalCities.put("USA", "Washington DC");
    System.out.println(capitalCities);

To access a value in the HashMap, use the get() method and refer to its key:
capitalCities.get("England");

To remove an item, use the remove() method and refer to the key:
capitalCities.remove("England");

To remove all items, use the clear() method:
capitalCities.clear();

To find out how many items there are, use the size() method:
capitalCities.size();
