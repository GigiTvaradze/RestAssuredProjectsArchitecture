Serialization : process Java object into request body

Deserialization : process Request body to Java object

Design Approach:
Java object is constructed with the support of POJO classes.
POJO classes are created based on the Request/Response payload.


A plain old Java object (POJO) is a class definition that is not tied to any Java framework so any Java program can use it.
A POJO has no particular naming convention for properties and methods, or any other special restrictions.Their primary advantage is their reusability and simplicity.


basic employee POJO :

public class EmployeePojo {

    public String firstName;
    public String lastName;
    private LocalDate startDate;

    public EmployeePojo(String firstName, String lastName, LocalDate startDate) {
        this.firstName = firstName;
        this.lastName = lastName;
        this.startDate = startDate;
    }

    public String name() {
        return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
    }

    public LocalDate getStart() {
        return this.startDate;
    }
}
