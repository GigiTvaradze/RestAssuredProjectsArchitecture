The DataProviders in TestNG are another way to pass the parameters in the test function.
DataProviders pass different values to the TestNG Test Case in a single execution and in the form of TestNG Annotations.
It is a part of the inbuilt TestNG data-driven testing for which TestNG is quite popular.

DataProvider Syntax:

@DataProvider (name = "name_of_dataprovider")
public Object[][] dpMethod() {
    return new Object [][] { values}
}

The TestNG DataProvider (the annotation part) contains only one single attribute, which is its name. It is always a string type in nature.
DataProviders are not declared on top of the functions like TestNG parameters but have a method of their own, which in regular speaking terms called a dataprovider method.
If the tester has not specified the name of the dataprovider, then the method name becomes the dataprovider name by default.
TestNG dataprovider returns a 2d list of objects.
The method then performs a data-driven test for each value that you have specified.
The dataprovider name calls the dataprovider method, and if there is no name specified by the tester, then the dataprovider method is the default name used in the receiving @Test case.
