Apache POI API: Data Driven Testing From Excel

Apache POI Common
Apache POI API Based On OPC and OOXML Schemas


Apache POI is an open-source Java-based library that can be used to handle the Microsoft Office Document by using Java-based programming language.
Is used to manipulate Microsoft Excel documents such as .xls and .xlsx file formats.
The test performance with the .xlsx file will be slower as compared to the .xls file in the Apache POI.

Strategy to Access Excel Data:
Create Object for XSSFWorkbook class
Get Access to Sheet
Get Access to all rows of Sheet
Access to specific row form all rows
Get Access to all cells of Rows
Access the Data from Excel into Arrays

//XSSFWorkbook class is part of the Apache POI library and is used to represent an Excel workbook (.xlsx file)
//fis: A FileInputStream object that is used to read the Excel file. It points to the location of the Excel file on the file system.
        FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream("/Users/gtv/Desktop/excelIntegration.xlsx");
        XSSFWorkbook workbook = new XSSFWorkbook(fis);
//XSSFSheet object representing the specified sheet.
        XSSFSheet sheet = workbook.getSheet("Sheet1");
//XSSFRow object representing the specified row,
        XSSFRow row = sheet.getRow(1);
//XSSFCell object representing the specified cell
        XSSFCell cell = row.getCell(1);


In Java, an Iterator is an object that enables you to traverse through a collection, one element at a time.
It provides methods to iterate over a collection and to safely remove elements from the underlying collection during the iteration.

Iterator<Row> rows = sheet.iterator();
Row firstRow = rows.next();
Iterator<Cell> cells = firstRow.cellIterator();

Key Features of Iterator
Traversal: Allows you to loop through a collection in a sequential manner.
Removal: Allows you to remove elements from the collection during iteration
